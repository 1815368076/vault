## Performance Replication
#### Web UI

1. Select **Replication** and check the **Performance** radio button.

1. Click **Enable replication**.

1. Select the **Secondaries** tab, and then click **Add**.

1. Populate the **Secondary ID** field, and then select **Configure performance
mount filtering** to set your mount filter options.  You can filter by
whitelisting or blacklisting. For this example, select **Blacklist**.

1. Check **EU_GDPR_data** to prevent it from being replicated to the secondary
cluster.

1. Click **Generate token**.

1. Click **Copy** to copy the token.

1. Now, launch the Vault UI for the secondary cluster (e.g. https://us-central.compute.com:8201/ui), and then click **Replication**.

1. Check the **Performance** radio button, and then select **secondary** under the **Cluster mode**. Paste the token you copied from the primary.

1. Click **Enable replication**.

~> **NOTE:** At this point, the secondary cluster must be unsealed using the
**primary cluster's unseal key**. If the secondary is in an HA cluster, ensure
that each standby is sealed and unsealed with the primaryâ€™s unseal keys. The
secondary cluster mirrors the configuration of its primary cluster's backends
such as auth methods, secret engines, audit devices, etc. It uses the primary as
the _source of truth_ and passes token requests to the primary.


Restart the secondary vault server (e.g. `https://us-central.compute.com:8201`)
and unseal it with the primary cluster's unseal key.

```plaintext
$ vault operator unseal
Unseal Key (will be hidden): <primary_cluster_unseal_key>
```

The initial root token on the secondary no longer works. Use the auth methods
configured on the primary cluster to log into the secondary.

**Example:**

Enable and configure the userpass auth method on the **primary** cluster and
create a new username and password.

```shell
# Enable the userpass auth method on the primary
$ vault auth enable userpass

# Create a user with admin policy
$ vault write auth/userpass/users/james password="passw0rd" policy="admin"
```

-> Alternatively, you can [generate a new root token](/guides/operations/generate-root.html)
using the primary cluster's unseal key. However, it is recommended that root
tokens are only used for just enough initial setup or in emergencies.


Log into the **secondary** cluster using the enabled auth method.

```plaintext
$ vault login -method=userpass username=james password="passw0rd"
```


### <a name="step3"></a>Step 3: Verify the replication mount filter

Once the replication completes, verify that the secrets stored in the
`EU_GDPR_data` never get replicated to the US cluster.


On the **EU** cluster, select **EU_GDPR_data** > **Create secret**:

![Secrets](/assets/images/vault-mount-filter-12.png)

Enter the values and click **Save**.  Repeat the step to write some secrets at
the **US_NON_GDPR_data** path as well.


On the **US** cluster, select **US_NON_GDPR_data**. You should be able to see
the `apikey` under `US_NON_GDPR_data/secret`.

![Secrets](/assets/images/vault-mount-filter-13.png)

The **EU_GDPR_data** data is not replicated, so you won't be able to see the
secrets.


### <a name="step4"></a>Step 4: Enable a local secret engine

When replication is enabled, you can mark the secrets engine local only.  Local
secret engines are not replicated or removed by replication.

Login to the **secondary** cluster and enable key/value secret engine at
`US_ONLY_data` to store secrets only valid for the US region.


Be sure to select the check box for **Local** to keep it mounted locally within
the cluster.
