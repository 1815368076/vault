## Unseal

![](/assets/images/vault-ui-guide/vault-ui-init3.png)

When Vault is sealed, the UI dialog appears as the above example; note that the
highlighted section that specifically calls out **Vault is sealed**.

You can use the UI to unseal Vault by providing the necessary threshold of
unseal key shares in the appropriate **Key** fields, and then selecting
**Unseal** to attempting unsealing. Successful unsealing will reveal the **Sign
in to Vault** dialog.
